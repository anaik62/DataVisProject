# Deploying the Code

The code can be deployed by using the following command in the *project's root directory*. For proper functioning, please ensure that the server is created from the project folder, and not from an upper level directory.

This command will create a local python server for the project.
```
python -m http.server 8080
```
After this open the browser of your choice and use this http://localhost:8080/ to access the project.
