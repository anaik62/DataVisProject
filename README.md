# About

The project is an interactive and scalable data visualization using D3.js, HTML, and CSS to depict transportation trends.
Transportation data from 1975 to 2020 was cleaned and manipulated to gain insights on fatalities caused by various modes of transportation.

# Deploying the Code

The code can be deployed by using the following command in the *project's root directory*. For proper functioning, please ensure that the server is created from the project folder, and not from an upper level directory.

This command will create a local python server for the project.
```
python -m http.server 8080
```
After this open the browser of your choice and use this http://localhost:8080/ to access the project.
